# Official Sentry SDK for PHP

[![Monthly Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/sentry/sdk/d/monthly)](https://packagist.org/packages/sentry/sdk)
[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/sentry/sdk/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/sentry/sdk)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/sentry/sdk/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/sentry/sdk)

This is a meta package that **historically** shipped [sentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) with an HTTP client.

We recommend using [sentry/sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php) instead.

```bash
composer require sentry/sentry
```

Since this is only a meta package, if you are finding this repo and having issues, please create an issue on our main repository's [issue tracker](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/issues)
